Online Store
-A site visitor has the opportunity to buy any product presented on the product catalog page.
-Place an order (personal information, delivery method, payment method, etc.)
-If you have chosen the payment method by card, go to the checkout page and collect your payment information. (https://stripe.com/docs/pays/checkout/accept-a-paying)
On the server side, after placing an order, the database should have the following results: Products, Customer, Order.
